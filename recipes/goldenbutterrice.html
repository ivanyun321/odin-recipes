    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, 
        is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. 
        It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, 
        it really is rice cooked in butter. This is my favorite version, 
        with seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.</p>
